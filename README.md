# AquaLib
AquaLib is my attempt at making a Subnautica Lua-Based Addon System similar to that of Garry's Mod.
As of now this is still **HEAVY W.I.P** - Its not possible to do almost anything yet.


## Features
- Managing Player Health
- Adding Custom PDA Entries
- Adding custom items (planned - not added yet)
- Spawning Stuff into world (planned - not added yet)
- A lot more stuff (planned - not added yet)
